I like to be able to center things, and arrange things using \r `display: grid;`.\r * That I can spend way too much time on css...\r * `box-sizing: border-box;` is a very useful change to make.\r * Box-shadows have a lot of applications\r * I got to see how async and await functions work better, its starting to make more sense.\r * It was also cool to see how local storage storage works hands on.",
