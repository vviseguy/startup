# Startup

The full-stack startup project that I would like to persue is an Inversus-style multiplayer online game. 

The website it will be hosted on may be found here: https://vviseguy.click/

## The Premise

Basic features would include, movement, hitboxes, and saving high scores (for now, representing the win-loss score card of the player).

If time permits, I would like to add a single player mode, which high score would also be attactehd to a user's account. This single player mode would also incorperate AI enemies. As it stands now, this would scale easily to a cooperative mode as well.

For those not familiar with _Inversus_, know that it is a minimalistic cross platform game, not yet avaliable on the browser.

## Possible Challenges

As is the biggest challenge will likely be keeping both (or all) players interacting with eachother in real time. I would like to minimize traffic to the server and back, so I will have to ensure that the client-side renderer is *extrememely* consistant. To the point of rendering the same pixel-perfect output regaurdless of the frame rate of the cient computers.

I anticipate that live connection, score keeping, login and the other tests I do not now know how to hande will be addressed as I go through the course.

## Other Features

Other possible features include setting a color pallette, having more than one lives, and power-ups, and I will build the infastructure with these in mind, but not necessarily implement them until later. Moving stages would also be really fun to incorperate, but (as I have already begun on the collision boxes for the basic game, this may be more complicated than I have time for).
